## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### The API was deprecated recently. This app does not work now.

# Currency Converter App
    Made a Currency converter app in React.js which also has a graph showing last 15 days rate.
    Used chart.js for that.

    Check out the app at [netlify] (https://sam-currency-converter.netlify.app/) or [github-pages] (https://awesomek101.github.io/currency-converter/)
